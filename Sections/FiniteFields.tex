\subsection{Finite Fields}

\begin{prob}{(S20.RF2)}{S20.RF2}
Let $\F_3$ be the field with 3 elements.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Prove that $K = \F_3[x]/(x^2 + 1)$ is a field.
\item How many elements does $K$ have?
\item Prove that $x+1$ generates the multiplicative group of non-zero elements in $K$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{proof}
	Let $f = x^2 + 1$. The only way for $f$ to be reducible over $\F_3$ is if $f$ has a root in $\F_3$. However this is impossible since $f(0) = 1$, $f(1) = 2$, and $f(2) = 2$. By Kronecker's Theorem, a polynomial ring quotiented out by an ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial is a field.
\end{proof}

\begin{solution}
	Let $\ol{1}$ and $\ol{x}$ denote the images of $1,x \in \F_3[x]$ under the quotient map. By Kronecker's Theorem, $\{\ol{1},\ol{x}\}$ form a basis for $\F_3[x]/(x^2 + 1)$ over $\F_3$. Therefore there are $3^2 = 9$ elements in $K$.
\end{solution}

\begin{proof}
	Since $|K| = 9$, the multiplicative group will have eight elements. Let $I = (x^2 + 1)$. Through algebraic manipulations, we see that 
		\[(x+1+I)^2 = 2x + I\]
		\[(x+1+I)^3 = 1 + 2x + I\]
		\[(x+1+I)^4 = 2 + I\]
		\[(x+1+I)^5 = 2 + 2x + I\]
		\[(x+1+I)^6 = x + I\]
		\[(x+1+I)^7 = 2 + x + I\]
		\[(x+1+I)^8 = 1 + I\]
	proving that $1 + x + I$ generates $K^*$.
\end{proof}

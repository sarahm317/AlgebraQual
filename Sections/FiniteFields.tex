\begin{prob}{F14}{F14.G2}
	Prove that the multiplicative group of nohnzero elements of a finite field is cyclic.
\end{prob}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose that $F$ is a finite field and let $K = F^\times$ be the multiplicative group of nonzero elements in $F$. Since $F$ is finite, $K$ is finite -- let $|K| = n$. Let $a \in K$ be of maximal order, say $m$. By Lagrange's Theorem, $m | n$ and $m \leq n$. Suppose now that $b \in K$ is arbitrary and of order $r$.

	\begin{claim}
		There exists an element $c \in K$ of order $\lcm(r,m)$.

		\begin{proof}
			\textcolor{red}{Look for shorter proof of this!.}
		\end{proof}
	\end{claim}

	Then the order of $c$ is $\lcm(r,m) \geq m$. Because $m$ is the maximal order of elements in $K$, $\lcm(r,m) \leq m$ and therefore $\lcm{r,m} = m$. Since $r$ divides $\lcm{r,m} = m$ and $b$ is of order $r$, it follows that $b^m = 1$. As $b$ was an arbitrary element of $K$, every element of $K$ is a root of the polynomial $x^m - 1$. This polynomial has at most $m$ roots and therefore $n \leq m$. This implies that $n = m$ and whence $K$ is cyclic and generated by $a$.
\end{proof}

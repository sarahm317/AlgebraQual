\subsection{Characteristic and Minimal Polynomials}

\begin{prob}{(F20.LA2)}{F20.LA2}
	Prove or give a counter example.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item If a $4 \times 4$ real matrix has characteristic polynomial $x^4 -1$ then its minimal polynomial cannot be $x^2 - 1$.
	\item Every $n \times n$ real matrix is similar over the reals to an upper triangular matrix.
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{prob}
	
	\begin{proof}
		Notice that $x^4 - 1$ has four distinct roots, namely $\pm 1, \pm i$. Since $x^2 - 1$ has roots $\pm 1$ and the characteristic polynomial divides some power of the minimal polynomial, it is impossible for $x^2 -1$ to be the minimal polynomial.
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{solution}
		This is false: consider the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1\\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix has no eigenvalues over the reals. If $A$ were to be similar to an upper triangular matrix, the (1,1) entry would need to correspond to an eigenvalue which is impossible.
	\end{solution}

\begin{prob}{(F14.LA2)}{F14.LA2}
	Prove or provide a counterexample: the characteristic polynomial of a matrix with entries in a field $K$ must be irreducible in the ring $K[x]$.
\end{prob}

\begin{solution}
	This is false. Let $K = \R$ and consider the matrix
		\[A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}. \]
	The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $(x-1)^2$ which is clearly reducible over $\R[x]$.
\end{solution}

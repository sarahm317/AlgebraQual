	\begin{prob}{F12}{F12.G2}
	Define the center of a group.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Prove that if the order of $G$ is $p^k$ for some prime $p$ then $G$ has nontrivial center.
	\item Suppose that $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes. Prove that a non-abelian group of order $pq$ has trivial center.
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{prob}
	
	The center of a group $G$ is the subgroup
		\[Z(G) = \{g \in G: gx = xg \textrm{ for any $x \in G$} \} \]
	
	\begin{proof}
	Assume that $|G| = p^k$ for some prime $p$. Suppose that $Z(G)$ is trivial and consists only of the identity element $e \in G$. If $k = 1$, the order of $G$ is prime which implies that $G$ is cyclic and therefore abelian. Therefore, assume that $k > 1$.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{prob}{F12}{F12.RF3}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Prove that $\Z/m\Z$ has no non-zero nilpotent elements if and only if $m$ has no multiple prime factor.
	\item Prove that every element of $\Z/m\Z$ is either nilpotent or a unit whenever $m$ is a prime power.

	\end{enumerate}
	\end{prob}
	
	\begin{prob}{F12}{F12.LA1}
	Let $V$ be the vector space of real $n \times n$ matrices. Show that 	
		\[\langle A, B \rangle = n \tr(AB) - \tr(A)\tr(B) \]
	defines a symmetric bilinear form on $V$.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Prove that $\langle,\rangle$ is singular.
	\item Prove that the restriction of $\langle,\rangle$ to the subspace $W$ of symmetric matrices with 0 trace is positive definite.
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{prob}
	
	\begin{prob}{F12}{F12.LA2}
	Suppose that $V = X \oplus Y$ and define the projection $V \to X$ by $\alpha(v) = x$ where $v = x+y$.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for an endomorphism $T: V \to V$ to be a projection is that $T^2 = T$. Identify $X$ and $Y$ in the case that this condition is satisfied.
	\item Prove that projections $T_1$ and $T_2$ have the same range if and only if $T_1T_2 = T_2$ and $T_2T_1 = T_1$.
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{prob}

	\begin{proof}
		Suppose first that $T: V \to V$ is a projection map. That is, for any $v = x + y \in X \oplus Y = V$, $Tv = x$. Then,
			\[T^2v = T(T(x+y)) = T(x) = x = T(x+y) = Tv\]
		and therefore $T^2 = T$.\\

		Now assume that $T^2=T$. Let $v = x+y \in V$ be arbitrary. Observe that $T^2 x = Tx$ and therefore $x - Tx \in \null(T)$.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{prob}{F21}{F21.G3}
	Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct odd primes. Use the Sylow Theorems to show that every group of order $p^2q^2$ is not simple.
	\end{prob}	
	
	\begin{proof}
	Suppose that $|G| = p^2q^2$ and without loss of generality, assume that $p < q$. Note that each Sylow $p$-subgroup is of order $p^2$ and each Sylow $q$-subgroup is of order $q^2$. Furthermore, the number of Sylow-$p$ subgroups is $n_p = 1, q, q^2$ and the number of Sylow-$q$ subgroups is $n_q = 1, p^2$. If $n_q = 1$, then the Sylow-$q$ subgroup is normal in $G$ and thus $G$ is not simple. Suppose instead that $n_q = p^2$.\\
	
	If $Q_i, Q_j$ are any two distinct Sylow-$q$ subgroups, the intersection $Q_i \cap Q_j$ is either of size $1$ or $q$. If every pairwise intersection between the Sylow-$q$ subgroups is trivial, then the $p^2$ Sylow-$q$ subgroups account for $p^2q^2 - (p^2 -1)$ elements implying that $n_p = 1$. That is, the Sylow-$p$ subgroup is normal and therefore $G$ is not simple. Suppose that some Sylow-$q$ subgroups$Q_1, Q_2$ have intersection of size $q$. Let $N = Q_1 \cap Q_2$ and let $M$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. Then, $|M| > |Q_1| = q^2$ and $|M|$ divides $|G| = p^2q^2$. Therefore $|M| = pq^2$ or $|M| = p^2 q^2$. 
	
Note first that any group of prime squared order is abelian. Therefore both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are abelian and so $N = Q_1 \cap Q_2$ is normal in $M$. If $|M| = p^2q^2$ then $M=G$ and thus $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and is nontrivial.\\

Now suppose that $|M| = pq^2$. 
	\end{proof}

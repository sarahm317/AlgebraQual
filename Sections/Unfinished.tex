\begin{prob}{F21}{F21.G3}
Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct odd primes. Use the Sylow Theorems to show that every group of order $p^2q^2$ is not simple.
\end{prob}	

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $|G| = p^2q^2$ and without loss of generality, assume that $p < q$. Note that each Sylow $p$-subgroup is of order $p^2$ and each Sylow $q$-subgroup is of order $q^2$. Furthermore, the number of Sylow-$p$ subgroups is $n_p = 1, q, q^2$ and the number of Sylow-$q$ subgroups is $n_q = 1, p^2$. If $n_q = 1$, then the Sylow-$q$ subgroup is normal in $G$ and thus $G$ is not simple. Suppose instead that $n_q = p^2$.\\

If $Q_i, Q_j$ are any two distinct Sylow-$q$ subgroups, the intersection $Q_i \cap Q_j$ is either of size $1$ or $q$. If every pairwise intersection between the Sylow-$q$ subgroups is trivial, then the $p^2$ Sylow-$q$ subgroups account for $p^2q^2 - (p^2 -1)$ elements implying that $n_p = 1$. That is, the Sylow-$p$ subgroup is normal and therefore $G$ is not simple. Suppose that some Sylow-$q$ subgroups$Q_1, Q_2$ have intersection of size $q$. Let $N = Q_1 \cap Q_2$ and let $M$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. Then, $|M| > |Q_1| = q^2$ and $|M|$ divides $|G| = p^2q^2$. Therefore $|M| = pq^2$ or $|M| = p^2 q^2$. 

Note first that any group of prime squared order is abelian. Therefore both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are abelian and so $N = Q_1 \cap Q_2$ is normal in $M$. If $|M| = p^2q^2$ then $M=G$ and thus $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and is nontrivial.\\

Now suppose that $|M| = pq^2$. 
\end{proof}
